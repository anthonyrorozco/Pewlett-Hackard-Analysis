# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Project

In order to create a plan for hiring new employees and to create a mentorship effort, the goal of this analysis is to conduct a database analysis for Pewlett Hackard with specific information on the number of future retirees from all departments currently employed at the company.

## Results

- Before starting the project, we created the SQL tables in advance. A data analyst should use an ERD to design the tables they will develop and how they will connect to other tables.

## Retirment Planning

- After analyzing our data, we can determine that a sizable number of employees will be retiring in the upcoming years. We can see from the current situation that more than half of the personnel will shortly retire.
