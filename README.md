# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Project

In order to create a plan for hiring new employees and to create a mentorship effort, the goal of this analysis is to conduct a database analysis for Pewlett Hackard with specific information on the number of future retirees from all departments currently employed at the company.

## Results

- Before starting the project, we created the SQL tables in advance. A data analyst should use an ERD to design the tables they will develop and how they will connect to other tables.

## Tables
- We have created 16 separate tables with our ERD in place using our prior knowledge and SQL intelligence. We create tables to determine when employees were employed and will be retiring in the future using the employee numbers as a connecting factor.

## Retirment Planning

- After analyzing our data, we can determine that a sizable number of employees will be retiring in the upcoming years. We can see from the current situation that more than half of the personnel will shortly retire.

## Mentoring The Future

- With a significant influx of retirees, we may use them to teach the younger generation and have a bright future inside the organization. Consequently, from this list of excellent possibilities, we have a lot to choose from.(1500+ rows of candidates)

## Summary

- Pewlett Hackard employees will soon be retiring in very large numbers! This is not a problem if it's addressed and organized, therefore let's start right away! We can start using this data to have our elders mentor the next generation in preparation for their holding positions. We might also begin hiring at a normal rate to accommodate the employees who will be leaving us.
